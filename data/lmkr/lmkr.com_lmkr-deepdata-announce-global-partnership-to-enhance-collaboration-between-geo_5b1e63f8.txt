LMKR & DeepData Announce Global Partnership to Enhance Collaboration between Geologists & Engineers in Unconventional Completion
LMKR
June 20, 2018
LMKR and DeepData have announced an exclusive partnership that aims to boost well production and reduce costs with a cloud-based solution for engineered completions that leverages rich geologic and petrologic information. DeepData & LMKR are enabling LMKR curves to be imported and leveraged by DeepData’s completion design tool that enables engineers to rapidly and easily generate completion designs. Once this is completed, it outputs stage-by-stage perforation plans and pump schedules.
LMKR will immediately begin offering a co-branded version of DeepData’s cloud-based completion solution that integrates with its GVERSE and GeoGraphix solutions.
“ We believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our technologies can combine to deliver increased value for our joint customers “

“We are excited to work with LMKR to unlock the value of their geoscience and leverage it to design and build better wells enabling geologists and completion engineers to collaborate on design once again, powers real increases in well productivity.”

Until now geologists had no completion design tools designed to leverage the rich collections of geology and petrology data. LMKR provides a leading tool for evaluating rock data and generating data-rich curves describing the rock along laterals. DeepData provides tools for completion; from design, through actuals. By integrating these tools, LMKR and DeepData are breaking down the geology and engineering silos and enabling geo-driven completion design.
