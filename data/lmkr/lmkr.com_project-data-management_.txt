Data Migration Services
Regardless of the reason behind your decision to upgrade your existing database management system, the most important consideration while doing so is to ensure that it either accepts your data in its current format or that your data is translated to a format that complies with the new database management system. Our approach towards data migration is not only limited to reformatting your data, we also ensure that your data is quality controlled once it has been loaded into the new system. With prior experience in migrating E&P data for national oil companies, international oil companies and services companies, we can migrate the following data types between multiple data sources from a diverse range of vendors:
Seismic 2D & 3D
SEGY 2D & 3D Data
Navigation Data

Data Loading, Validation, Consolidation & Distribution Services
Due to its sheer volume and complexity, collecting E&P data is a complicated practice that requires extensive knowledge about multiple data sources as well as processes applied to transform and load data into a target information management system. Our approach towards loading, validating, consolidating and distributing E&P data is based on the extract, transform and load process. Supported by a pool of highly skilled domain experts with years of experience on multi-vendor data management solutions, LMKR facilitates you in ensuring that your E&P data caters to your business objectives by enabling you to make informed business critical decisions.
