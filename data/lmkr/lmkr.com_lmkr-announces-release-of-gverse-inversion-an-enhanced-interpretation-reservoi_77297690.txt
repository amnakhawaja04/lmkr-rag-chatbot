LMKR announces release of GVERSE Inversion, an enhanced interpretation, reservoir prediction and geosteering solution
LMKR
June 7, 2017
The latest addition to LMKR GVERSE suite is developed in partnership with FracGeo LLC. GVERSE Inversion is a colored inversion solution that provides a rapid, yet robust way to derive geological details in the form of relative and absolute impedance. When geosteering through a reservoir, the high resolution impedances calculated by the colored inversion ensure that the well is drilled through ideal rock. GVERSE Inversion is completely integrated with the GeoGraphix® suite of products.
GVERSE Inversion is the result of strategic partnership with FracGeo LLC aimed at integrating FracGeo’s software solutions and products with LMKR’s GVERSE™ and GeoGraphix® Product suites. The partnership focuses on development of new software technologies and products to help LMKR’s clients adapt their workflows to the new oil price environment.
