LMKR Invests in USLandGrid to Provide GeoGraphix® Access to Oil and Gas Data at the Click of a Button
LMKR
June 1, 2015
LMKR today announced its strategic investment in USLandGrid to provide direct access from its GeoGraphix® product suite to the oil and gas data which USLandGrid provides. Typically, accessing and loading oil and gas data is a time consuming, multi-step process. Offering a direct connection from GeoGraphix will speed up data loading and enable the user to be productive in a much shorter time, as compared to traditional methods.
“USLandGrid and LMKR have a very similar philosophy – helping our users to be more efficient at success. GeoGraphix® is a fully featured geoscience system offering capabilities which range from geological oriented reconnaissance to engineering driven divestiture. Providing direct access to this type of data is a critical piece of the front-end workflow and will result in tangible time saving for the user.”
“We are excited about the new opportunities this partnership brings. It will greatly expand the reach of USLandGrid.com while adding valuable knowledge and resources to our development efforts. For the end user, the new relationship translates into enhanced data that seamlessly loads directly into the industry leading geoscience system.”
Anthony Ford, Director US Land Grid, Inc.
