Title: LMKR Partners with FracGeo LLC to deliver innovative fracture geomechanics software solutions
Date: 2016-02-10T07:41:12

February 10, 2016 LMKR today announced a long term strategic partnership with FracGeo LLC aimed at integrating FracGeo’s software solutions and products with LMKR’s GVERSE™ and GeoGraphix® Product suites. The partnership will include developing connectors for integration as well as integration in development of new software technologies and products to help LMKR’s clients adapt their workflows to the new oil price environment. “LMKR’s partnership with FracGeo will enable us to deliver advanced completion optimization techniques integrated with LMKR’s GVERSE™ and GeoGraphix® Products. FracGeo’s proprietary modeling services and products coupled with LMKR’s technology and expertise will help us add new computation tools to overcome major limitations of existing and traditional geomechanical and frac design approaches that will make our clients more efficient and effective.” Atif Khan, Chairman and CEO LMKR “Today, we are bringing to the Geoscience world the practical and rapid deployment of fracture Geomechanics, a critical component as it enables our clients to assist the engineering community by correctly simulating the impact of fractured reservoirs on our completion and well performance. The ability to simulate and validate the impact of our stimulation decisions on well performance directly impacts the bottom line of our clients. Together with LMKR, we are building software solutions that will change the way completions are designed and executed.” Dr. Ahmed Ouenes, CEO and Founder FracGeo About FracGeo FracGeo was founded to develop and deploy new geomechanical technologies needed for optimal frac design, completion and well spacing optimization in unconventional reservoirs. These technologies focus on the estimation of subsurface properties affecting hydraulic fracturing including the natural fractures and their complex interaction with regional stress and hydraulic fractures. This modeling uses new and fast computational tools that overcome the major limitations found in the existing software to accurately represent the physics of stimulation of fractured reservoirs.
