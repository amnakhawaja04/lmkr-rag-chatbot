November 10, 2013 The Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists’ hosted the 31st Annual International Conference and Expo in Lagos, Nigeria. This year’s theme focused on stimulating exploration and reserves growth in a maturing basin. The event attracted more than 2500 visitors and provided exhibitors the opportunity to showcase their latest technology. LMKR and Reighshore Energy Services* exhibited together at booth B12. Traffic at the booth was plentiful and allowed for group demonstrations of the upcoming GeoGraphix 2014 release. Of particular interest was the new field planning capabilities, tighter geophysics and geology integration and new advanced 3D visualization features which have previously existed only in premium brands. With live demos, one-on-one meetings and efforts from our sales, technical and marketing teams, LMKR and Reighshore presence in LAGOS was certainly noticed. * Reighshore Energy Services Limited is a leading Exploration and Production consultancy firm providing efficient solutions to the everyday challenges within the E&P sector. Reighshore Energy Services is LMKR’s authorized reselling partner in Nigeria.
