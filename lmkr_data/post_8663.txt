Date: 2024-05-31T08:28:35

LMKR has signed an agreement with Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO) to implement a groundbreaking Web-Based GIS and Mobile Application system. The agreement, signed on May 22, promises to revolutionize GEPCO’s distribution network management, ushering in an era of enhanced transparency, efficiency, and cost savings. The project centers on developing a mobile app and a web-based GIS application to streamline feeder data collection through field surveys. This data will be hosted in a centralized state-of-the-art datacenter with high availability and disaster recovery, creating a unified information source for GEPCO’s entire network. Additionally, the system will leverage geospatial data to perform automatic line loss calculations, empowering GEPCO to optimize network performance. To ensure seamless operation and efficient data management for the new system, LMKR will also provide GEPCO with the latest hardware IT infrastructure. Through this initiative, GEPCO will gain a comprehensive view of their entire distribution network, enabling them to identify and address inefficiencies with greater ease. The project establishes a central data hub, eliminating scattered information and ensuring consistent data access. Furthermore, automatic line loss calculations based on geospatial data will empower GEPCO to optimize network performance and reduce costs. With real-time data and insights at their fingertips, GEPCO can make data-driven choices regarding network maintenance, expansion, and resource allocation. “By implementing this innovative GIS solution,” said Nasir Tanveer, VP Technology Business & Alliances at LMKR, “we are confident that GEPCO will gain a significant advantage in managing their distribution network. Improved visibility, informed decision-making, and optimized performance will ultimately translate to a more reliable and efficient power supply for GEPCO’s customers.” About LMKR LMKR is a diversified technology company with an extensive solutions portfolio that includes reservoir-centric interpretation , smart urbanization, agri-tech, big data services , AI-driven technology solutions, and consulting .
