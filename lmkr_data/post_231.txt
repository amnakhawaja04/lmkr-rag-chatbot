November 11, 2016 LMKR proudly announced the successful completion of a study project titled “Shale Gas, Shale Oil and Tight Gas Study in Kohat Plateau, Pakistan” for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Oil and Gas Company Limited (KPOGCL), Pakistan. The prime objective of this study was to highlight and rank the prospective formations, their lateral and vertical extents, and most importantly delineation of the areas of high concentrations. LMKR delivered the following services to KPOGCL: Geological mappings at the scale of 1:50,000 of approximately 6000 km2. Field stratigraphic logs and sample collection Petrographic analyses of target formation samples to deduce the provenance, interpretation of paleo environment, evaluation of relative porosity and permeability Petrophysical analyses using conventional well logs for determination of unconventional petrophysical properties of target formations 2D seismic interpretation to map lateral and vertical extents of formations in the sub-surface Geochemical and mineralogical analyses from renowned laboratories Unconventional play characterization on the basis of integration of Geological, Geochemical, Sedimentological and Petrophysical properties. The constructive outcome of this evaluation study has helped KPOGCL professionals identify and prioritize areas for further studies on the shortlisted shale, carbonate and sand units.
