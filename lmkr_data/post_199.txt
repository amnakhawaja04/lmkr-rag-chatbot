For exploration, we help you identify sweet spots, hydrocarbon potential, and leads & prospects for new exploration blocks and acreages. Our team of experienced geoscientists and reservoir engineers can help you in reserves estimation, asset evaluation, and reserves certification. Our expertise in upstream disciplines range from surface geology to reservoir simulation. For details of each discipline please select the following links: Geological Field Studies/Mapping Using a modern approach of remote sensing and GIS technologies, our team of experienced of structural geologist and sedimentologists delivers accurate results with high quality maps. LMKR’s field geological studies and service offerings are as follows: Determination of lateral & vertical extents and thickness of targeted formations Lithofacies description of target formation in any stratigraphic section Faults identification on surface Construction of field stratigraphic and biostratigraphy log Sedimentary structures identification and defining bedding patterns Gross depositional environment maps Petrographic analysis to determine the paleo environment and provenance of different depositional units Prospect Identification using results of structural geology Seismic acquisition plan using results of structural geology Petroleum System Modeling Determining the possible presence as well as extent of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-bearing rocks in a basin is the ultimate goal. We have expertise in basin evaluation and can deliver high quality results in a limited time frame. Using top of the line solutions for modeling, LMKR offers: Basin classification and structural analysis Sequence stratigraphy Depositional environments Play fairway analysis Common risk segment mapping Petrophysical Interpretation For the understanding of reservoir and its detailed characteristics, our expert Petrophysics team can help interpret rock properties. Our offerings under petrophysical interpretation services are as follows: Pre-job planning and acquisition support Designing of logging programs to address formation evaluation challenges Tool combination plan for optimal data quality, wellsite efficiency and safety Real-time support and QC of logging data and sample quality Standard interpretation Detailed formation evaluation Log analysis of both carbonate and clastic rocks Quick look, qualitative & quantitative log interpretations, core calibration, pay zone identification and perforation interval selection Petrophysical analysis of unconventional reservoirs Interpretation of RFT/MDT data Integrated interpretation to determine field reserves
